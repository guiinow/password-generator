# password-generator
Contains a very straightforward script that generates passwords using python 


## The usage is as follows: 


We are going to use some pretty simple functions of the string module in python


string.ascii_letters
Concatenation of the ascii (upper and lowercase) letters

string.digits
The string ‘0123456789’.

string.punctuation
String of ASCII characters which are considered punctuation characters in the C
locale.

print(string.ascii_letters)

print(string.digits)

print (string.punctuation)

The expected output is:

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
0123456789
!”#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~
